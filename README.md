# notivuecation

Promise-based alert and confirm modal for Vue.js. 

## install

```sh
npm install notivuecation
```
## example
Run the demo in the example folder:
```sh 
cd example
npm install
npm run dev
```

Or you can check out that exact same page [here](https://petervdn.github.io/notivuecation/example/).

## basic usage

1 - Activate the plugin.
```javascript
import Vue from 'vue';
import notivuecation from 'notivuecation';

Vue.use(notivuecation);
```

2 - Add the component that renders the notifications. You probably want to put this somewhere in the root component of your site, so it can always be visible. There is a simple component (named `notivuecation`) available, but you can also create and use your own.
```
<notivuecation />
```

3 - Call `$alert` or `$confirm` from any Vue component:
```javascript
this.$alert('You are the 1 millionth visitor!').then(claimPrize);

this.$confirm('Are you sure?').then(result => {
  // result is true/false
});
```

## overview
The plugin adds three methods to the Vue instance, these can be called from any Vue component:

* `$notify`
* `$confirm`
* `$alert`

If you want to use these methods from outside a component, you can also import them: 

```javascript
import { confirm, alert, notify } from 'notivuecation';
```
(this will obviously replace the native `confirm` and `alert` methods in the current scope)  

### notify
The `notify` method is the base of the plugin and is internally always used to show any notification. It accepts an object that defines the title, a message and all buttons to show:
```javascript
this.$notify({
  title: 'Claim prize',
  message: 'Pick a color for your car!',
  buttons: [
    {label: 'red', value: 1, css: 'red'},
    {label: 'green', value: 2, css: 'green'},
    {label: 'blue', value: 3, css: 'blue'},
  ]
});
```
The optional `css` property on the buttons will be set as css class on the button, while the `value` (also optional) will be used when resolving the promise (i.e. this is the value that will end up in the `then` when clicking the button).

### confirm and alert
`confirm` and `alert` are shorthand methods that call `notify` with some predefined data to cover most usecases. Use these methods to show either a notification with Ok/Cancel buttons or just a single Ok-button. Both accept roughly the same parameters object:

```javascript
this.$confirm({
  title: 'Warning!', // default is either 'Confirm' or 'Alert'
  message: 'Please confirm that you have read this.',
  confirm: 'Sure man', // default is 'Ok'
  cancel: 'No way',  // default is 'Cancel', not used for $alert
}).then(result => {
  // result is true/false when using $confirm, and not set for $alert
});
```

Both methods can also be called with a string as argument, which is the same as using an object with only the `message` property set. So these two are equal:
```javascript
this.$confirm('Are you sure?');
this.$confirm({message: 'Are you sure?'});
```

When using `confirm` or `alert`, all confirm buttons will have the css-class `confirm` and all cancel buttons `cancel`.

## styling
The default component has some basic styling to overlay the content and show the message.
For your own project you might want to use custom styling for the notification itself.
There are some basic styles and simple classes which you can override easily.
A small example when using CSS Modules (with SCSS) in your Vue project.

```
<notivuecation :class="$style.notification" />
```

```scss
:local {
  .notification {
    background: rgba(#000, 0.3);

    :global {
      .notivuecation-content {
        background: #000;
        color: #fff;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Which would make the notification mask lighter, the content background black and the content contrasting white.


## custom component
If you want to use your own component for displaying the notification, just add the `componentMixin` to your component's mixins. It will add the following properties to the component: `title`, `buttons`, `message`, `type`, `resolve` and `notification`.

```javascript
import { componentMixin } from 'notivuecation';

Vue.component('custom-component', {
  mixins: [componentMixin],
  template: `<div v-if="notification">
      <h1>{{title}}</h1>
      <p>{{message}}</p>

      <button
        v-for="button in buttons"
        :class="button.css"
        @click="resolve(button.value)"
      >{{button.label}}</button>
    </div>`,
});
```

__Make sure to use `v-if="notification"` (or `v-show`) to show or hide the notification.__


If your component needs to do specific logic (like validation or animations), the only thing you need to call in the end is `this.resolve(someValue)`.
```javascript
Vue.component('my-custom-component', {
  mixins: [componentMixin],
  methods: {
    onButtonClick(button) {
      doAnimations().then(() => {
        this.resolve(button.value);
      });
    },
  }
});
```
## queueing
While the idea of a modal window is to prevent all interaction until the user has interacted with the modal, it can occur that a notification is opened while there is already one visible.

What happens is that every new notification is simply added to the end of a queue. When closing a notification and there are more waiting, the next one will simply show up until the queue is empty.  

## options
When initializing the plugin, you can supply an object as second argument to set some options. 

```javascript
Vue.use(notivuecation, {
  someOption: 'someValue',
});
```
The available options are:

* `addMethodsToVue`: Whether the `notify`, `alert` and `confirm` methods should be added to the Vue instance. Default: `true`.
* `componentName`: Name of the default component. Default: `'notivuecation'` . This defines the element name you should use for the component: `<notivuecation />`
* `getButtonForEscape`: Can make the escape-key close a notification in certain cases. A function should be set (which receives the notification-data as argument) that returns the button that will be used when pressing the escape key. The default will make the key work in two cases: the cancel button for a `confirm` call, or the single button when there is only one. If you don't want the escape key to do anything, you can set the property to null.
